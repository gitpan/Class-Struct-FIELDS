TODO for Perl extension Class::Struct::FIELDS.

1.2
	- See if can drop gratuitous 5.6 isms and backport to 5.005 or
	  earlier.
	- What about non-ARRAY, non-HASH TIE support?
	- Should _* methods be always created?  If a subclass of a
	  package using overrides wants to call the _* version of an
	  accessor to guarantee accessing the underlying data type, it
	  doesn't know it can call the _* version without first
	  checking that this subroutine exists.

	- Bite the bullet and implement pragmas so that caller can
	  enable lvalue subs and experimental features.

1.1
	- Fix baseclass warnings issues (mini prolog?).
	- What about nested types?  ARRAY of HASH, etc.?  Notation
	  might be:

	    use Class::Struct::FIELDS Bob => [],
	      { a_of_h => '@%Fred' }; # ARRAY of HASH of FRED

	- What about package-level fields?  (Class members v. instance
	  members)
	- Support class members and accessors (notation?).  And
	  mixture, too:

	    sub new_request {
	      if (UNIVERSAL::isa ($_[0], __PACKAGE__)) { # object method
	        my CQoDP $self = shift;
	        $self->request->new (@_);
	      }

	      else { # class method
	        CQoDP::Request::->new (@_);
	      }
	    }

	- Use of hidden members for user overrides should be a flag
	  for &import; consider using Pragmatic.
