Revision history for Perl extension Class::Struct::FIELDS.

1.1 Sat Oct 14 07:28:56 2000
	- Auto-stringify.
	- EXPERIMENTAL: tied hashes and hashes whose elements must be
	  IS-A certain packages.  THIS IS AN UNDOCUMENTED FEATURE, AND
	  MAY BE REMOVED IN THE NEXT RELEASE (or made documented and
	  supported).
	- Try using AutoLoader again.  It works now.  Why?
	- Tied support recognizes overrides.
	- Hidden (_*) versions for tied ARRAY and HASH when caller
	  uses overrides for these (e.g., sub Some::Class::FETCH).
        - Corrected CREDITS.
	- Renamed _object_{hash,array} to _{hash,array}_object to make
	  AutoSplit happy.

1.0 Mon Sep 25 10:36:31 2000
	- Allow caller to declare subs that override access methods
	  before they are defined.  This helps with coding.
	- Fixed "use Class::Struct::FIELDS <implicit caller>"; the
	  import had failed to erase the interposing stack frame, so
	  &struct guessed wrong at the package to construct.
	- Test all combinations of arguments for importing.
	- Differentiate "struct CLASS, LIST" case from "struct LIST"
	  (implicit CLASS) since one has an odd, the other an even
	  number of arguments.  Document the change.
	- Cleaned up diagnostics and their documentation.
	- Fixed bug in UNIVERSAL::isa replacement where the sub failed
	  for blessed objects, but worked for package names.
	- Support "hidden" member access as helper for user overrides.
	- EXPERIMENTAL: tied arrays and arrays whose elements must be
	  IS-A certain packages.  THIS IS AN UNDOCUMENTED FEATURE, AND
	  MAY BE REMOVED IN THE NEXT RELEASE (or made documented and
	  supported).

0.9 Sun Sep 24 11:15:26 2000
	- Fixed member constructor for \Class case.
	- Test all combinations of arguments for &struct (added some
	  more since last set of tests).
	- Fixed some cases where not returning a reference after
	  assignment to a member.
	- Fixed several bad diagnostics.
	- Fixed several doc bugs and missing diagnostics.
	- Fixed warnings enable/disable.

0.8 Thu Sep 21 08:58:13 2000
	- Fixed argument checking bug in &struct.  Updated
	  documentation to reflect the change.
	- Test all legal calls to 'struct' and creates an example
	  object of each.
	- Call 'struct' during import if there are arguments.

0.7 Wed Sep 20 20:47:00 2000
